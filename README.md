# Global-Power-Plant
this data analytics report provides valuable insights and analysis on the Global Power Plants dataset, showcasing the importance of data cleaning, visualization, and analysis in deriving meaningful insights and making data-driven decisions.
This data analytics report focuses on the Global Power Plants dataset, where I analyzed and cleaned the data to derive insights and answers to key questions. Using R language in R Studio, I employed data cleaning techniques to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the dataset, and performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.

The report presents descriptive statistics of the dataset, including its size, structure, and composition. I then used visualization techniques such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to present the data in a meaningful and understandable way.

The report also addresses key questions related to the dataset, such as the distribution of power plants by country, fuel type, and capacity, as well as the top power plant operators and their contributions to global power generation.
